# Pinello Lab · Onboarding Automation Scripts

A cross-platform toolkit that turns a blank laptop **and** a brand-new Linux
cluster account into a fully-configured development environment in minutes.

| Script | Platform | What it does |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `scripts/local/onboarding_local_mac.sh` | **macOS 12 +** | Installs VS Code + extensions, generates SSH keys and copies them to ml007 (with password prompt), then triggers the remote bootstrapper using key-based authentication. |
| `scripts/local/onboarding_local_windows.ps1` | **Windows 10/11** | Same as mac, **plus** optional WSL 2 install & networking tweaks. Compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and 7+. |
| `scripts/remote/onboarding_remote.sh` | **Cluster (Debian/Ubuntu)** | Adds shared software to `PATH`, sets up Mamba/Conda, personal env folder, Jupyter password, VS Code server settings, and fixes SSH permissions. |

*Everything runnable lives in `scripts/`.
Local scripts call the remote script via a relative path, so you can clone
anywhere and just run.*

## 1 · Prerequisites

| macOS                      | Windows                                 | Remote Linux                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Bash 3.x + (pre-installed) | PowerShell 5 + (or `pwsh`)              | SSH access to **ml007.research.partners.org** |
| Git                        | Git & **\[winget]**                     | Write access to `~/.bashrc`                   |
| —                          | (Optional) admin rights for WSL install | —                                             |

> **Mac note**  You may be prompted to install Apple’s Command-Line Tools
> (Git/SSH) on first use.

## 2 · Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinellolab/onboarding.git
cd onboarding
```

---

## 3 · Run the local script

### macOS

```bash
chmod +x scripts/local/onboarding_local_mac.sh
./scripts/local/onboarding_local_mac.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\scripts\local\onboarding_local_windows.ps1
```

During execution you can choose to:

1. Install Microsoft Teams and VS Code (plus WSL 2 on Windows).
2. Install VS Code extensions **Remote-SSH**, **Python**, **Jupyter**, **Copilot**.
3. Provide your **MGH username** for cluster access.
4. Generate an SSH key (if missing) and copy it to ml007 (**you'll be prompted for your password once**).
5. Run the remote bootstrapper using passwordless SSH key authentication.

---

## 4 · What the remote script does

`onboarding_remote.sh` runs on the first cluster host you connect to and:

* Adds `/data/pinello/SHARED_SOFTWARE/bin` to `PATH`.
* Initialises **Mamba + Conda** and creates a personal `envs` directory.
* Optionally sets a **Jupyter Lab** password (v 2.16).
* Writes fresh VS Code *Machine* settings so the Python extension
  auto-selects the shared Miniforge interpreter.
* Ensures `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` exists and has the correct permissions.

> Re-running the script is safe & idempotent – no duplicate lines or conflicts.

## 5 · Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                | Fix                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code` CLI not found (mac)             | Launch VS Code once and run **"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"**, or `export PATH="/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin:$PATH"`. |
| `winget` not recognised (Win)          | Install the Windows Package Manager from the Microsoft Store or upgrade to Windows 10 21H2 / Windows 11.                                                                   |
| `Host key verification failed` on SSH  | This is normal for first-time connections. The scripts now automatically accept host keys, but you may need to clear old entries with `ssh-keygen -R ml007.research.partners.org`. |
| `Permission denied (publickey)` on SSH | The SSH key setup may have failed. Re-run the local script and ensure you enter your password when prompted during the key copying phase.                                |
| VS Code on server shows no interpreter | Connect once, then *Python → Select Interpreter* and pick the **Miniforge3** entry ending in `/bin/python`.                                                                |

2. Edit scripts inside `scripts/`.
3. Run `shellcheck` on `.sh` and `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` on `.ps1`.
4. Open a pull request — CI will run the linters automatically.
